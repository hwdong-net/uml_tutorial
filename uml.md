关于 UML，首先要注意的是有很多不同的**图表（模型）** 需要习惯。这样做的原因是可以从许多不同的角度来看一个系统。软件开发将有许多利益相关者参与其中。(The first thing to notice about the UML is that there are a lot of different diagrams (models) to get used to. The reason for this is that it is possible to look at a system from many different viewpoints. A software development will have many stakeholders playing a part. For example:Analysts，Designers，Coders，Testers，QA，The Customer，Technical Authors)


Class Diagram is a UML diagram where you can visualize those classes, along with their attributes, operations and the inter-relationship.


A use-case model describes a system's functional requirements in terms of use cases. It is a model of the system's intended functionality (use cases) and its environment (actors). Use cases enable you to relate what you need from a system to how the system delivers on those needs.
